Both conditions with influx of patients requesting assessment and specific diagnosis, but I believe for very different reasons.\n\nWith ADHD it seems easier to me. Perhaps because there is a indicated gold-standard treatment. Many times these patients are presenting with a focused struggle (i.e. trouble in college) but pan-endorse all symptoms going back until childhood. If you inappropriately diagnose someone with ADHD you may treat them with a medication that will either improve their symptoms or not. If medication doesn't help the patient is more likely to be open to alternative diagnoses or explanations for their struggles (i.e. depression).\n\nWith ASD it seems like a larger disservice to the patient and also those appropriately diagnosed. Young adults are seeing ASD more like an identity. Its validating for many, but also dismisses the idea that there may be countless alternative explanations for their distress. \"I was born this way\" kind of mentality which could prevent a depressed person from considering medication, or a person with BPD from engaging in DBT.\n\nThere is also a strong gut feeling component from the MSE.

Everyone. They look good on anyone. Short, tall, rotund, petite. They work because they follow science based rules in their design. Pants are already versatile, unisex, and cover about 2/3s of the body without much thought. Pleats bring a visual and practical enhancement no other pant provides. \n\nWhy Pleated? \n\nComfort. Practicality. Aesthetics.\nPleated pants get a bad rap but they are one of the comfiest and stylish articles of clothing. \n\nComfort: Pleats are made by gathering extra material which are folded and tucked into the waistband of trousers. When the wearer makes movements such as sitting, kneeling, squatting or walking, this extra fabric gives to these movements and returns to its closed position when standing or resting upright. Pleats keep the fabric away from the wearers body maximizing airflow.\n\nPracticality: Pleats allow the wearer to make use of the trouser\u2019s pockets without unsightly bulges/pulling typical of their flat-front counter parts. Therefore, it reduces wear, friction, or stress on the seams and fabric resulting in a longer lifespan of the trousers. \n\nAesthetics: Pleats offer a distinct look no other pant can. It provides several focal points for the eyes to latch on to and imbues every outfit with the rule of thirds effortlessly. \n\nThe darting in the front makes the eyes travel vertically down the crease of the pants revealing a cuff resting on the wearer\u2019s tastefully picked footwear. The reverse happens when the mid-high waist of the pleated waistband draws the eyes up to the belt line, top garments, and accessories . The eyes aren\u2019t struggling by viewing breaks in the wearer\u2019s figure the pleats have grounded them as a single column of curated intricacies.\n\nTHE SCIENCE OF PLEATS\n\nThis section will guide you on how to buy, thrift, or sew the pleated pant. It can be personalized but some guidelines are there to keep what makes the pleat great. It\u2019s Drape. It all boils down to the drape. Everything else can be personalized to you but The Drape is non negotiable.\n\nWAIST\n\nIt should be mid to high rise. Waistband needs to either sit above, on, or slightly below your belly button; your natural waist line. Take a measurement of your crotch.  When shopping use this to find trousers that corresponds with your crotch measurements when you tally its front and back rise respectively.\n\n*avoid* Low rise. Big fat NO. Low rise will give you child birthing hips, and make you look dumpy. You\u2019ll no longer benefit from the drape or the rule of thirds it provides. \n\nLEGS \n\nFull cut legs. Wide legs. Straight legs. Relaxed legs. This is one of the elements that give the pleated trouser its signature drape. It keeps the fabric away from your body, reduces unsightly creases, and gives that not trying too hard unassuming cool it\u2019s known for. \n\nYou can opt for full length with your choice of trouser break and cropped variations. \n\n*avoid* carrot fit legs (trendy, these age terribly), slim legs, or skinny legs. Why even pleat? Just go flat-front. \n\nCUFFS \n\nYour cuffs can vary anywhere between 1\u201d to 2\u201d. Play with this until you find what works for your frame. Cuffs keep the pant crease straight and uniform when lined up with the main pleat when ironed, and makes the bottom of the pant leg heavy so your pleats remain closed while standing/resting. When in stride the cuffs keep the legs straight, balanced, and visually smooth.\n\nLEG OPENING \n\n I need to repeat this again. YOU NEED A CUFF! not only for the reasons mentioned above, that is unless you want your pants leg pooling around the shoe or dragging as seen today\u2019s modern styling. Then please ignore. \n\nThat said, your leg opening needs to cover  at-least 2/3 of your shoe. This will keep your trousers straight and give that lovely pant-shoe interaction. \n\ne.x i wear a size 15. My leg openings are usually 22-24\u201d. I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d and my pleated trousers fall straight and break over my shoes while looking proportional to my frame. If i want a slightly tapered look, i opt for 20\u201d leg opening still meeting the 2/3 rule according to my shoe size. \n\nTUCKS \n\nYour personal preference comes in here, but here\u2019s some of what usually works.\n\n1 tuck - good for slim, slim-tall, small, petite, shorter frames. It doesn\u2019t add excessive bulk. It provides the comfort and drape while keeping your figure streamlined. The most natural for people of this body type. \n\n2 tucks - athletic, big or tall, spherical frames. This number of tucks for this group of people gives a slimming effect while providing ample room in the thigh/glutes due to the extra fold. Simply put, they can fill this out more and it\u2019ll remain proportionate to their larger frames. Smaller frames can partake but need to play with rise, fabric type/weight and etc. to minimize the bulk. This is the most popular and visually striking tuck for pleated pants.\n\n3 tucks - Vary rare in traditional menswear and no one would need this many tucks unless built like you\u2019re \u201conly as good as your last envelope\u201d Tony Soprano. I have seen this mostly done by brands (Margiela, Bottega, Valentino) looking to exaggerate the flow or bagginess of their garment.\n\nEXTRAS\n\nBuckle backs, side adjusters, elasticated waistbands, etc. Do it up to your hearts content. Just keep to the guidelines above and you\u2019ll have a trouser that will keep serving you.\n\nWHO MAKES THEM?\n\n- Casatlantic \n- MFPEN\n- Scott Frazier \n- Buzz Rickson (other Japanese repro)\n- Albus Lumen\n- Ralph Lauren (Andrew Fit ebay)", "title": "The Definitive Guide on Pleats", "permalink": "/r/ThrowingFits/comments/1ah5teo/the_definitive_guide_on_pleats/", "scores": {"Negativo": 0.04291503503918648, "Neutro": 0.8711645603179932, "Positivo": 0.08592044562101364}}
