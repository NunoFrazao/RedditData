It seems like every day there's something in the media from YLC, and I'm sick of it. Musk is probably too optimistic with his deadlines, as usual, but I still think his estimates are more likely than what YLC keeps repeating, that we are far, far away from AGI. The truth is, we have no idea how close we are to AGI, and many other prominent scientists admit this.\n\nEdit2: You're right if you think Reddit isn't any better. People say I defend Musk and call me a fanboy. For fuck's sake, the first thing I wrote was that Musk is the worst. I have hated Musk for decades.

E.g. a blurry mess that looks like a person gets high resolution features that shapes like this had in the dataset. The nice thing is that the dataset includes many different people and we are able to learn a model how the features behave instead of slapping the same high res version of a person on everything. This works as long as our dataset is large enough and includes a big variety of images, so we are forced to learn general rules instead of memorizing stuff. Otherwise an effect called overfitting occurs, where we memorize an specific example and are able to reproduce it near perfectly. This is generally a bad thing as it get in our way of learning the underlying rules. The datasets used to train these models include millions or billions of images to get a large enough variety. But commonly photographed things like the moon can be an issue as they are so many times in the dataset that the model still overfits on them. So they might have used just a large dataset with naturally many moon pictures in it and the general AI sharpening overfitted on the moon. This can happen easily, but it does not rule out the possibility that they deliberately knew about it and still used it for advertisement, which would be kind of shady.",

I know he didn't want to be mean, but like... you've witnessed me giving 30 min speeches about rabies and metal subgenres unprompted and steal cutlery from uni because I liked them better than the ones at home, I'm also doing the stereotypes, please pay attention.",

The videography in iPhones is still unmatched even by the S24 Ultra. Also, iPhones always tend to have better resale value than Android devices. iOS takes a bit getting used to but is fine for the most part. Also while the S24 has just launched, the iPhone is ~4 months old so you might be able to get some discounts. (It was launched for $1000 in India, but last week my sister got one and we were able to get it for around $850). Also, this might just be my preference/bias but what Samsung is doing with their current line of smartphones in terms of design is not it. All the models from $300 up to $1000 price range are practically indistinguishable and it kind of diminishes the uniqueness and excitement one expects to feel while spending big bucks for a Flagship device. \n\nOne major downside is a bloody 60 Hz screen for $800 dollars, but seeing that you come from an older Samsung device, you will still find it to be a lot more smoother. Another point of contention is that iPhones usually receive 5-6 software version updates on top of the one that is present at time of launch but this year, Samsung has promised 7 years of OS updates, so you might be more interested in that.",

I see this with the child in our home also--he's been evaluated by multiple professionals and no one evaluating him formally has felt that ASD was a fitting explanation for his behaviors or needs, but lay people around us love to opine that he must have ASD because this loud, disruptive, frankly immature kid seems more severe than what they imagine ADHD alone would explain. We have been pushed by random moms at activities to have him see even more professionals until someone gives him an ASD diagnosis. \n\nI can absolutely see how these things appear as a spectrum or difficult to differentiate at the more severely hyperactive ends of ADHD, and I think sometimes the addition of ASD helps to validate the challenges of managing behaviors. I've also been told by developmental pediatricians I rotated with that having that diagnosis opens up more resources, so they find themselves sometimes utilizing that diagnosis to improve access to therapies while subjectively they're not confident that there's truly a distinct ASD presentation at play.",

        "body": "Something worth asking is whether ADHD is truly a genuine comorbidity of ASD and ID, or if ADHD is so broadly defined that any set of executive and attention deficits from any etiology (ID, ASD, mood, NCD, anxiety, SUD, OCD, BPD) COULD be interpreted as ADHD as long as an evaluator would like to imagine the possibility of some internal separation, or an earlier and more subtle onset.\n\n\nIf the latter were NOT the case, then there would be clear rules about how ADHD can specifically be differentiated from cognitive deficits inherent to ID or ASD. (If those cognitive deficits are the same, then the entity would not be separately defined.)\n\n\nRead the criteria and ask if this is the case.**\n\n\n\nThis is not to say that I don't think there's some core Primary Disorder of Vigilance (that is, whatever entity that *should* be captured by the ADHD construct) which is unique and separate from other neurodevelopmental impairments. The Primary Disorder of Vigilance also would be expected to have higher comorbidity with other ND disorders given the likelihood of genetic contribution.\n\n\nThe point I'm making is that there does not appear to be any significant attempt to rigorously define the borders of these conditions in the field. I think you're right to wonder about it. I don't think there's any enthusiasm from the experts to find out or create any separation beyond a few prevalence studies. Speaking about the degree of comorbidity is meaningless if the core constructs have not been separated through a scientifically informed process.\n\n\n**The problem, as I see it, is that the DSM has never made any significant attempts to formally differentiate any disorder from another except in select explicit cases. Instead, it insinuates that some entities are a Thing In Itself, and that others are linked and not fully separate, and others are caused by this and that. The lack of specific separation leaves room for professional judgment but also allows poorly trained clinicians to go wild in their diagnostic process. Wild diagnosis is then taken as real, rather than clinical. This is a failure of the etiology neutral approach, the dictionary function of the manual, and the professional consensus method of construction.",

I have one and they're smooth af and snappy as hell (provided they're not that old). Even flagship Androids at times can't keep up at certain things. They're rock-stable as well.\n\nBut it really depends on how you use them to justify their cost (same goes for other flagships). My gf, for example, has a 13 PM. She's nowhere near techie, but it works for her and i can say the price she paid for it was worth it. She has an iPad and a Mac, and seamlessly transfering files alone (for one) is something I'd love for Android to have. She rarely has any issues with her phone, and even uses it for work. Mine, meanwhile, can't really be justified because I'm more comfortable tinkering with Androids.\n\nThere are also iPhone myths (specially regarding privacy and security) that people seem to believe. You might want to check those out, as well.\n\nIn the end, a lot of people that I know buy iPhones because of one of two things:\n1. Status symbol\n2. \"simplicity\"",

In which case, that sucks you didn't get the piece of paper. \n\nBut in terms of just having it to know for yourself, in terms of understanding yourself, this clinical test designed to isolate and identify autism is frankly not worth that much. Autism has been very rigidly defined and the testing criteria have only recently been expanded. \n\nRemember it wasn't very long ago that girls and women were basically excluded from an autism diagnosis altogether, and there are still rigid ideas of what autism 'is'. Whether you get a diagnosis or not can depend on the person giving you the test.\n\nIt's a terribly unreliable system and if you spend a lot of time on autism reddit, you'll see many people being told they aren't autistic, for a number of reasons that should not be disqualifying.\n\nMost of us undiagnosed adults have been asking for years and years why we find things so hard, and no one has any answers for us. So we make up our own answers, and they are usually very self-critical. Basically we consider ourselves defective, lazy, stupid, or any other toxic idea.\n\nWhen we learn about autism, it's like 'holy shit, this explains so much of my life, I don't have to beat myself up anymore!' \n\nBut here's the thing, even without an official diagnosis, you don't have to beat yourself up. You are different, and it's not *your fault* if you find life hard. We live in a world that isn't designed for us, otherwise we would be thriving. \n\nSo what I'm saying is that you DO relate to the rest of us. I'm not diagnosed, and I relate to people here. I don't need a piece of paper to validate my decision to accept myself. Neither do you. Keep using the subreddits and being part of the community. Don't go back to self-loathing and despair. There's nothing there worth keeping.",

I eventually learned to manage it with a very restricted diet and to this day I don't know exactly what it is, but it doesn't affect my life very much any more.  Ultimately, I'm glad I probably don't have an inflammatory bowel disease, but for a long time it really sucked not knowing what was going on with my body. \n\nWith regard to having subclinical autistic traits (Broader Autism Phenotype), this is something that people don't talk about very much.  That is really a shame, because depending on how you define it, there are more people in this category than there are people with ASD.   I wish this was discussed more because there are a lot of people like you who experience social differences but don't fit neatly into existing diagnostic categories.

An online bank he was invested in merged with Cofinity to form PayPal, which was bought by Ebay. With his share of the profits he started SpaceX. \n\nHe invested in existing car manufacturer Tesla starting in 2004. He forced out the the two founders of Tesla in 2007. In 2018, the SEC successfully sued Musk for lying about securing funding to take Tesla private. He paid a $20 million fine and was forced out as chairman of Tesla. \n\nMusk bought Twitter for $44 million, three to four times what it was worth. Musk tried backing out of the Twitter deal, but his lack of knowledge of contracts law and failure to secure competent legal counsel meant he\u2019d be forced by a Court to complete the sale. He uses the platform to tweet about his right-wing views, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, his apartheid-like world view, and unscientific views on vaccinations. Twitter is now a platform utilized mostly by white supremacists and characterized by political misinformation.\n\nMusk\u2019s personal life has revealed a man with no emotional control, from tweeting favorably about Hitler to calling rescuers of Thai children trapped in an underwater cave pedophiles. He seems to have no sense of morality, having 11 children with three different woman. \n\nMusk has been in discussions with Donald Trump\u2019s camp regarding a cabinet position if he were to win the 2024 presidential election. Musk\u2019s fascist-like views have led to comparisons to Mussolini and Adolph Hitler. \n\nSo basically, Elon Musk is the world\u2019s biggest a-hole.",
