[{"id":"kirp0nb","body":"I like the iPhone color tones better but it's a personal choice, anyways the night photography is objectively better on iPhone.\n\nEdit: [The original video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/jY3m6g5ThwU?si=0ws5froXKbsDjoRr)."},{"id":"kis74iu","body":"The iPhone seems more true to life colour wise and most importantly more consistent."},{"id":"kise19c","body":"Thanks for the comparison. Why does this dude look so angry or he has to go poop, or maybe he\u2019s angry cause he has to go poop."},{"id":"kitwfew","body":"honestly iphone just looks way cleaner and better. and looking at the night photos its very clear that apple still wins."},{"id":"kirz7zh","body":"I'm split down the middle on these. Some look better from the Samsung and some look better from the iPhone. One thing is for sure, they both have really good cameras. I think it really just comes down to personal preference because there's nothing in it between these two."},{"id":"kiu7uwb","body":"- Hey Bixby, can you please make me taller, more muscular, replace my bicycle with a Lamborghini and the inflatable doll I\u2019m hugging with 3 top models?\n- Yessir!\n- Oh, and can you also remove the fucking purple tone from every freaking picture?\n- No can do sir"},{"id":"kisbd5r","body":"In regular light conditions both phones are really good, but in low light conditions the Samsung does really poorly. Super grainy, purplish tint, everything is smoothed. I had an iPhone 12 Pro and I upgraded to the Galaxy S23 over the summer and the low light camera performance (and front camera) were both really awful and I ended up switching back to iPhone."},{"id":"kiu9c9r","body":"Nicely done, iPhone is way better in all shots."},{"id":"kisekmr","body":"It\u2019s like Samsungs algorithms at night are still from 2008."},{"id":"kishaaj","body":"Samsung\u2019s night shots are hilariously bad."}]
